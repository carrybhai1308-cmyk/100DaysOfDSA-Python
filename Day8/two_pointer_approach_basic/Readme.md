# 🚀 Day 8 – Two Pointer Approach Basics

This is **Day 8** of my **#100DaysOfDSA Challenge**.  
In this day, I solved problems using the **Two Pointer Technique**, which is widely used in arrays and string problems to optimize brute force solutions.

---

## 🎯 Goal
Learn and practice the **Two Pointer Technique** to solve array problems efficiently (O(n) or O(n log n)).
