# Day 9 – Sliding Window & Two Pointers Exploration | 100 Days of DSA

## Introduction
Welcome to **Day 9** of the **100 Days of DSA Challenge**!  
Today’s focus is on exploring **Sliding Window** and **Two Pointer** techniques in depth.  
The goal is to solve multiple problems using these patterns and strengthen intuition for complex array/string manipulations.
